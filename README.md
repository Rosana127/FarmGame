# ðŸŒ¾ Farm Sim Paradise

An interactive **Farm Simulation Game** built with **Rust + WebAssembly**.  
Players can grow, harvest, fertilize, fight pests, complete tasks, and manage resources through the in-game shop â€” all inside the browser.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Crop Lifecycle Management**  
  From planting â†’ growing â†’ harvesting â†’ pest infestation, powered by a Rust state machine.
- **Shop & Inventory System**  
  Buy and use seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, insect nets, and manage coins strategically.
- **Task System**  
  Dynamic task tracking and reward collection to guide long-term play.
- **Pest System**  
  Random pest outbreaks requiring pesticide use for recovery, adding challenge.
- **Auto-Save Mechanism**  
  Game state is automatically saved in `localStorage`, enabling seamless resume.
- **Sound & Visual Feedback**  
  Each action comes with dedicated sound effects and tooltip feedback.
- **Modular Rust Architecture**  
  Core logic is implemented in Rust and connected to the frontend via wasm-bindgen.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/farm-sim-paradise.git
cd farm-sim-paradise
```

### 2. Install dependencies
Make sure you have installed:
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)  
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/)  

Install Trunk:
```bash
cargo install trunk
```

### 3. Run the development server
```bash
trunk serve
```

Open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser ðŸŽ®.

## ðŸ§ª Testing

- Functional test coverage includes:  
  - Crop lifecycle (plant/grow/harvest/pest)  
  - Shop & item system  
  - Task progression & rewards  
  - Save/load mechanism  
- Result: All modules work as expected, stable performance.  

---

## ðŸ“Š Highlights

- Compared to typical Wasm demos:  
  - Richer state machine (with pest system & insect nets)  
  - Enhanced interactions (drag-and-drop planting + tooltips)  
  - Long-term play supported (auto-save system)  
  - Immersive gameplay (sound effects, BGM, dynamic UI panels)
